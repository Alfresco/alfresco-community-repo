/**
 * The core Remote Credentials service.
 * 
 * This provides low level support for storing, retrieving and finding remote credentials. Most users will want something built on top of this, eg to do the OAuth Dance.
 * 
 * The "Remote System" name chosen by systems built on top of this need to be unique, to avoid clashes. Where there is only one thing that is talked to (eg Twitter, Flickr, Alfresco Cloud), then the "Remote System Name" should be the name of the system. Where one service can talk to multiple systems, the system hostname should be used as a suffix, such as "OpenID-livejournal.com" and "OpenID-stackexchange.net", so they can be differentiated.

   <shortname>GET archived (deleted) items</shortname>
   <description>
      Gets all nodes that have been deleted by the current user and remain in the archive store.
      If the user is an Administrator, then all the deleted nodes are fetched (regardless of who deleted the nodes).
      The URL template includes a store_type and a store_id and only nodes which were
      originally contained within the specified store will be included in the result set.

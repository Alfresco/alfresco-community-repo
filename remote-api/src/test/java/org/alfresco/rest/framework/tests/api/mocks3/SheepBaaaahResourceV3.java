/**
 * A mock version 3 relationship resource. This is attached to the SheepNoActionEntityResource action (version 1). In version 1, SheepNoActionEntityResource did no action. In version 2, SheepNoActionEntityResource was overridden by SheepWasNoActionEntityResource and given an action In this version (3) - a relationship resource is being added to the ORIGNAL entity (which has been overridden).
 * 
 * It is expected that this is correct behavior. This relationship resource could have been attached to either the SheepNoActionEntityResource or the SheepWasNoActionEntityResource with the same result. This is because they both use the same entity key (name="sheepnoaction")

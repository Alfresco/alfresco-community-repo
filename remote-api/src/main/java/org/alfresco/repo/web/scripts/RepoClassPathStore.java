/**
 * Extension of the SpringSurf ClassPathStore to ensure that the examination of last modified dates on classpath bound resources does not cause a performance degredation in REST heavy client applications.
 * <p>
 * In the repository, due to the possibility of Repository bound resources, all WebScript search path lists have the "delay" set to either zero seconds (no delay) or something close to that. This means that the FreeMarker template cache is always or often requesting the last modified date of a classpath resource - and the resources do not change. Note that the /extension classpath store still uses the original ClassPathStore. Otherwise all stores can be refreshed as usual via the Refresh WebScripts command.

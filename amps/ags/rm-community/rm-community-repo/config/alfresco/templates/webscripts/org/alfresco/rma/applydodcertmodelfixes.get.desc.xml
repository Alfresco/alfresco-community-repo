   <shortname>Applies fixes to the content model for DoD certification.</shortname>
   <description><![CDATA[
   This webscript applies necessary changes to the RM custom model in the repository. These changes
   are to 'patch' a deployed RM custom model during the DoD certification process. With that in mind
   they are safe to apply to a live database i.e. without side-effect to existing data and safe
   to call multiple times. They are not needed for a clean deployment.<BR/>
   Please note that this script will be removed after the certification process is complete.

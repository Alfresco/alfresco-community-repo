/**
 * An interface to be implemented by beans that can be 'turned off' by some configuration setting. When such beans are inactive, they will not perform any validation checks on initialization and will remain in a state where their {@link #isActive()} method always returns <code>false</code>. {@link ChainingSubsystemProxyFactory} will ignore any <code>ActivatableBean</code>s whose {@link #isActive()} method returns <code>false</code>. This allows certain functions of a chained subsystem (e.g. CIFS authentication, SSO) to be targeted to specific members of the chain.

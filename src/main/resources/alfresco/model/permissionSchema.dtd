<!-- 
    The permissionGroup element
    ===========================
    
    A permission group builds a new permisison group      
    using existing permission groups. These are specified 
    by the includePermissionGroup element.
    
    name - The simple name of the permission. The full name includes 
           the type uri from the outer permissionSet
           
    type - If the permission group extends another then this attribute can be used
           to specify the type it extends. Normally it would assume this follows
           the data dictionary type hierarchy.
           
    extends - does this permission group extend one that already exists?
    
    expose - if the the containing permission set does not expose all permission groups
             specify if this particular permission group is exposed or not.
             
    allowFullControl - if true, this permission group effectively grants all permissions
    
    requiresType - does this permissionGroup require the type (as specified on the containing permission set)
                   to be present. This is useful for permission groups tied to aspects. If false, the permission
                   group applies to all types - as they could have the aspect. If true, the permission group
                   only makes sense if the aspect has been applied

<!--
    The requiredPermission element
    ==============================
    
    name - the name of the required permission or permission group
    
    type - the type of the required permission or permission group
    
    on - if required permission must be present on the node, its primary parent, or its children 
    
    implies - false - the permission wil be checked
           - true - the permission is effectively granted along with this one.  
	
	       This will normally be false. For example, to require read permission on the
	       parent to be able to read the node. This requirement would be recursive,
	       as read on any node woudl require read on the parent of that node.
	
	       If true this is the case where this permission allows the user to 
	       take another action as it is required to carry out the first. Normally
	       you would protect the method call to require both permissions. This 
	       does really grant the other permission. If a permission A is defined that 
	       requires another permission B, with implies true, then granting someone
	       permission A will also grant permission B. If implies is false, then granting
	       A will not allow A until permission B is also available.

/**
 * Service interface for managing job locks.
 * <p>
 * Locks are identified by a fully qualified name ({@link QName}) and follow a hierarchical naming convention i.e. locks higher up a hierarchy can be shared but will prevent explicit (exclusive) locks from being taken. For example: If exclusive lock <b>a.a.a</b> has been taken, then <b>a.a</b> and <b>a</b> are all implicitly taken as shared locks. Exclusive lock <b>a.a.b</b> can be taken by another process and will share locks <b>a.a</b> and <b>a</b> with the first process. It will not be possible for a third process to take a lock on <b>a.a</b>, however.
 * <p>
 * <b><u>LOCK ORDERING</u>:</b><br>
 * The transactional locks will be applied in strict alphabetical order. A very basic deadlock prevention system (at least) must be in place when applying or reapplying locks and be biased against locks applied non-alphabetically.

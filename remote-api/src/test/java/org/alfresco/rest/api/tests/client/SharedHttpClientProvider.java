/**
 *
 * A class responsible for managing one shared {@link HttpClient} instance. This uses a thread-safe connection-manager instead of creating a new istance on every call.
 * 
 * This is done for the folowing reasons: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating new HTTPClient instances for each request has memory-overhead and most important, opens a new connection for each request. Even though the connection is released they are kept in 'CLOSE_WAIT' state by the OS. This can, on high usage, empty out available outgoing TCP-ports and influence the testing on the client, having impact on the results.</li>
 * <li>Using a single HTTPClient allows creating a pool of connections that can be kept alive to a certain route (route = combination of host and port) for a max number of time. This eliminates connection setup and additional server round-trips, raising the overall throughput of http-calls (Browsers use this mechanism all the time to lower loading-times).</li>
 * </ul>

/**
 * Simple listener that overwrites files with zeros.
 * <p/>
 * Wire this into the {@link EagerContentStoreCleaner} as a listener and it will ensure that files have their contents overwritten with zeros before deletion. Note that this process does not affect the content lifecycyle in any way i.e. content will still follow the same orphan path as before.
 * <p>
 * Clearly wiring this up with a {@link DeletedContentBackupCleanerListener} is pointless as you will be making a copy of the before wiping it or end up copying a file full of zero depending on the order of the listeners.

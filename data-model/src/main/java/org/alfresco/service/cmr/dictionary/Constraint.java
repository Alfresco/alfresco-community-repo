/**
 * The interface for classes that implement constraints on property values.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the actual constraint code should must not synchronize or in any other way block threads. Concurrent access of the evaluation method is expected, but will always occur after initialization has completed.
 * <p>
 * Attention to performance is <u>crucial</u> for all implementations as instances of this class are heavily used.
 * <p>
 * The constraint implementations can provide standard setter methods that will be populated by bean setter injection. Once all the available properties have been set, the contraint will be initialized.

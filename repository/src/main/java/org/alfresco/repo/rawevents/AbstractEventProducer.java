 * Abstract helper to send events to an endpoint. The <code>AbstractEventProducer</code> acts as a wrapper that provides marshalling for a Camel <code>ProducerTemplate</code>. <br/>
 * <p/>
 * A client has the option of creating an event producer without supplying an endpoint. In this case, a endpoint must be provided with every send operation. <br/>
 * <p/>
 * A client also has the option to provide an <code>ObjectMapper</code> that will be used to marshal basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to JSON before sending the event.

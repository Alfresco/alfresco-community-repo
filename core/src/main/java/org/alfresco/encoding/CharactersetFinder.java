/**
 * Interface for classes that are able to read a text-based input stream and determine the character encoding.
 * <p>
 * There are quite a few libraries that do this, but none are perfect. It is therefore necessary to abstract the implementation to allow these finders to be configured in as required.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should have a default constructor and be completely thread safe and stateless. This will allow them to be constructed and held indefinitely to do the decoding work.
 * <p>
 * Where the encoding cannot be determined, it is left to the client to decide what to do. Some implementations may guess and encoding or use a default guess - it is up to the implementation to specify the behaviour.

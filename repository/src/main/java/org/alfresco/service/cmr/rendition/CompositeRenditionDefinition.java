 * This is a special {@link RenditionDefinition} which allows sequential execution of a list of other {@link RenditionDefinition}s. For example, it might be used to transform a PDF file to a JPEG imaged and then resize that image. This would be achieved by creating a {@link CompositeRenditionDefinition} that has two sub-definitions, one to reformat the PDF to a JPEG image and the second to resize the JPEG image.

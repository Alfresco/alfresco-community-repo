 * The implementation of the Alfresco Imap Server
 * 
 * <p>
 * AlfrescoImapServer which implements the IMAP protocol. It contains an instance of the Ice Green ImapServer and delegates imap commands to AlfrescoImapHostManager and AlfrescoImapUserManager. AlfrescoImapHostManager in turn delegates to ImapService and AlfrescoImapUserManager uses the PersonService.
 * 
 * <p>
 * ImapServiceImpl provides the implementation of the various IMAP commands on an alfresco repository. Also contains the transaction and security boundary.
 * 
 * <p>
 * AlfrescoImapFolder contains the implementation of IMAPFolders and contains messages.
 * 
 * @since 3.2

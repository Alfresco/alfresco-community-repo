Company will not, during the Evaluation Period or thereafter (i) use the Software with the Alfresco Community software, (ii) distribute the Software to any third party or publish the Software in any way such that a third party could access it; (iii) transfer, use or export the Software in violation of any laws or regulations of any government or governmental agency; or (iv) reverse engineer, decompile or modify any portion of the Software.  Alfresco and its licensors will own all right, title, and interest to the Software, technology, information, code or software provided to Company, including all portions, copies or modifications thereof.

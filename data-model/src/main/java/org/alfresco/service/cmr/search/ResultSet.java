/**
 * This is the common interface for both row (Alfresco node) and column (CMIS style property or function) based results. The meta-data for the results sets contains the detailed info on what columns are available. For row based result sets there is no selector - all the nodes returned do not have to have a specific type or aspect. For example, an FTS search on properties of type d:content has no type constraint implied or otherwise. Searches against properties have an implied type, but as there can be more than one property -> more than one type or aspect implied (eg via OR in FTS or lucene) they are ignored An iterable result set from a searcher query.<b> Implementations must implement the indexes for row lookup as zero-based.<b>

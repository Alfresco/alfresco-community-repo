# See also   http://filext.com/alphalist.php
#
# Use  Scrape file-to-program association info from filext.com, in
#      order to help determine when GET vs HEAD should be performed.
#      Many lists of file-to-type associations exist, but to my
#      knowledge, http://filext.com is the most comprehensive and
#      accurate.  In in the end, this list is just used to create
#      an "include list" of what file types will be fetched via GET.
#
# Background:
#      For performance reasons, it's important to be able to figure out 
#      whether to do HEAD or a GET when validating links.  When you
#      don't need embedded links, you can always do HEAD, but if the result
#      might contain links you need to validate, the alternatives are:
#
#          [A]  Do GET when unsure  + make configurable GET exclude list
#          [B]  Do HEAD when unsure + make configurable GET include list
#          [C]  User-based config regarding what to do when unsure.
#
#      Analysis:
#
#         Option [A] is more complete, but the exclude list would be 
#         very hard to manage.   For example, as of 2007 an exclude 
#         list would need to contain over 20k entries to keep up with 
#         the association data at filext.com (see list below).   Also, 
#         when a previously unknown non text/html media type is hit,
#         the file size could easily be quite large... thereby needlessly
#         impairing network performance for everyone on the lan, and
#         delaying overall linkvalidation info for a snapshot considerably.
#
#         Option [B] has the potential for giving the user a false sense
#         of security by leading them to believe that a page has been 
#         validated when in fact it has not (due to not being on the
#         "include" list).   It might take a long time for someone to
#         notice.
#
#         Option [C] clearly provides the most flexibility, but with
#         that comes extra training cost, docs, and the potential for
#         making a mistake if the "right answer" is fairly clear-cut.
#
#         Option [B] make the most sense because [A] seems to have great 
#         potential for causing unnoticed & needless system-wide network 
#         performance problems, and delaying average-case validation checks.
#         Because [B] seems to dominate [A] so strongly, [C] is pointless.
#
#
# Aside:  How many lines would the equivalent Java program have been? :)
#         Cheers, Larry!  Much joy!

#
# Ethical/legal/politeness issue:
#
#         The folks at filext.com don't want this list displayed elsehere.
#         They say:
#
#                  Please honor the copyright on this list. 
#                  Do not copy it and display it elsewhere. 
#                  Thank you.
#
#         Presumably, this is so they can get ad revenue for the free
#         service they provide.  That seems quite reasonable.  While 
#         compendiums, tables, lists, charts, etc., are not subject
#         to copyright law, I'd still like to be respectful of the 
#         "sweat of their brow", and cause them no harm.  
#
#         Is inclusion of file association data in the source code of 
#         a program considered "a display" in the sense they intended?  
#         I don't think so.   Nobody in their right mind would choose to 
#         look at *this* file as the easiest way to get file/type data.
#         For example, none of the supplementary text is here, just the 
#         raw ext-to-file data.  Hence, I doubt I'll drive anybody from 
#         them, so no ad revenue will be lost, and no harm will be done. 
#
#         If there's a real objection from filext.com, I'd be happy to
#         remove the output of the program below from this file, out of 
#         courtesy.   Again, thanks for the outstanding website site!

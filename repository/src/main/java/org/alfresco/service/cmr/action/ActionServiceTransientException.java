/**
 * This exception should be thrown when an {@link Action} has not been run successfully due to
 * a transient condition and where it is possible that a subsequent request to execute the
 * same action might succeed.
 * <p/>
 * An example of this would be the case where a request to create a thumbnail
 * has failed because the necessary thumbnailing software is not available.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link ActionService} can be configured to run a {@link Action#setCompensatingAction(Action) compensating action}
 * when another action fails with an exception. If however the exception thrown is an instance of {@link ActionServiceTransientException}
 * then this compensating action will not be run.

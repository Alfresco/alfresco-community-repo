 * The Policy Component.
 *
 * Policy Component for managing Policies and Behaviours.
 * <p>
 * This component provides the ability to:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>a) Register policies</li>
 * <li>b) Bind behaviours to policies</li>
 * <li>c) Invoke policy behaviours</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A behaviour may be bound to a Policy before the Policy is registered. In this case, the behaviour is not validated (i.e. checked to determine if it supports the policy interface) until the Policy is registered. Otherwise, the behaviour is validated at bind-time.
 * <p>
 * Policies may be selectively "turned off" by the Behaviour Filter.

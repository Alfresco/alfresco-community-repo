 * Interface for home folder providers. Instances work with the {@link PortableHomeFolderManager} (which performs most of the work) to allow it to create home folders in custom locations.
 * 
 * The home folder may be a simple structure where all users share a root folder (See {@link ExistingPathBasedHomeFolderProvider2}), or all home folders are in the same root folder (See {@link UsernameHomeFolderProvider}) or in a tree of sub folders to avoids any single directory containing too many home directories which might cause performance issues (See {@link RegexHomeFolderProvider}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * If the HomeFolderProvider is changed, home folders may be moved by using the {@link HomeFolderProviderSynchronizer} which optionally runs on restart.

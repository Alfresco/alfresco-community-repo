<!--
    ** This configuraton is for tests only. **
    Applications or services should create specific 'query-xxx-common-SqlMap.xml' files to define
    queries required.

    The namespace must start 'alfresco.query.' and then contain the reference to the app using it.
    In this case, the application is 'test' so the filename is 'query-test-...' and the
    namespace is 'alfresco.query.test'.
    
    Select statements are prefixed 'select_' in Alfresco's config.  The underscore is important to
    prevent confusion (at a code level) between namespaces and the type of SQL statement.
    
    Hints:
        Do not use 'parameterMap' or 'resultMap' as these are deprecated in MyBatis (when last we checked).
        
        Ensure that all 'types' (see 'typeAlias') have concise toString methods to aid debugging.
        
        We are using SQL, so it is OK to embed '%' in wildcard strings.  It becomes unwieldy to assume
        that the client code always wants to match a prefix or suffix in 'like' clauses.  However, it
        is up to the application logic as to whether the '%' is embedded in the SQL or in the code.
    
    See class CannedQueryDAOTest for a demonstration.

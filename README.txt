== Alfresco Records Management - Development Environment Setup ==

Prerequisites

 - Maven 3.0.4 (or higher)
 - Eclipse Maven Plugin (m2e)
 - See Maven setup instructions https://ts.alfresco.com/share/page/site/eng/wiki-page?title=Maven_Setup


Initial Setup

 - Create a normal project using "create-project"
 - Check out RM code into the "code" directory (eg "checkout https://svn.alfresco.com/repos/alfresco-enterprise/modules/recordsmanagement/HEAD")
 - Create the tomcat instances using "use-tomcat7" and "use-app-tomcat7"


Using Eclipse

 - Import projects as Maven projects ("Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects")
 - Browse to the code directory of your project and select "rm-server/pom.xml" and "rm-share/pom.xml". DO NOT select the parent "/pom.xml"
 - Open the Ant view and add the build files for both modules ("build.xml")
 - Run the "prepareEnv" target for rm-server which will prepare the development environment. This target must be run just once.
 - Now "fullBuild" target can be run which will create the amp file, apply it to the war file and copy the war file to webapps folder.

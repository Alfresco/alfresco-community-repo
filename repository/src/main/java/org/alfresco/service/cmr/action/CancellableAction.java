/**
 * A marker interface that forms part of the Cancel Action contract. An action that implements this interface commits to periodically asking the {@link ActionTrackingService} if a cancel of it has been requested, and orderly terminating itself if so.
 * 
 * Actions implementing this should, via their {@link ActionExecuter}, periodically call {@link ActionTrackingService#isCancellationRequested(CancellableAction)} to check if a cancel has been requested for them. If it has, they should tidy up as much as possible, and then throw a {@link ActionCancelledException} to indicate to the {@link ActionService} that they ceased running due to a cancel.

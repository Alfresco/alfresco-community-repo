/**
 * This JUnit rule can be used to turn existing test code into Load Tests. It does this in conjunction with the {@link AlfrescoPeople} JUnit rule. That rule is used to {@link AlfrescoPeople#AlfrescoPeople(ApplicationContextInit, int) create} a fixed number of Alfresco users. Then {@link LoadTestRule} will do the following for each of your JUnit 4 &#64;Test methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if they are annotated with the {@link LoadTest} marker annotation:
 * <ol>
 * <li>one Java thread for each of the users created by the {@link AlfrescoPeople} rule will be created and started.</li>
 * <li>each of those threads will start by authenticating as a different user from the above set.</li>
 * <li>each of those threads will concurrently execute the same JUnit &#64;Test method.</li>
 * <li>if all the concurrent threads complete execution successfully, the &#64;Test method is passed.</li>
 * <li>but if one or more of those concurrent threads fail, the error messages will be aggregated together into a single error for that method.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <li>else they will be executed as normal and will pass or fail as normal.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Example usage, where we have a 'normal' feature test and a load test for the same feature.:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class YourTestClass
 * {
 *     // We need to ensure that JUnit Rules in the same 'group' (in this case the 'static' group) execute in the correct
 *     // order. To do this we do not annotate the JUnit Rule fields themselves, but instead wrap them up in a RuleChain.
 *     
 *     // Initialise the spring application context with a rule.
 *     public static final ApplicationContextInit APP_CONTEXT_RULE = new ApplicationContextInit();
 *     public static final AlfrescoPeople         TEST_USERS       = new AlfrescoPeople(APP_CONTEXT_RULE, 32);
 *     
 *     &#64;ClassRule public static RuleChain STATIC_RULE_CHAIN = RuleChain.outerRule(APP_CONTEXT_RULE)
 *                                                                     .around(TEST_USERS);
 *                                                              
 *     &#64;Rule public LoadTestRule loadTestRule = new LoadTestRule(TEST_USERS);
 *     
 *     &#64;Test public void aNormalTestMethod()
 *     {
 *         ensureFeatureFooWorks()
 *     }
 *     
 *     &#64;LoadTest &#64;Test public void aLoadTestMethod()
 *     {
 *         ensureFeatureFooWorks()

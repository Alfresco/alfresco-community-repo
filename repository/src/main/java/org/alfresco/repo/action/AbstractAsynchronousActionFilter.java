/**
 * This class is the base filter class for asynchronous actions. These filters are used in identifying 'equivalent' actions in the asynchronous action execution service. By registering a subclass of this type, all actions of a given action-definition-name that are still pending (i.e. currently executing or in the queue awaiting execution) will be compared to any new action and if they are equal (as determined by the compare implementation defined herein) the newly submitted action will not be added to the queue and will be dropped.
 * 
 * Concrete subclasses can be implemented and then dependency-injected using the spring-bean baseActionFilter as their parent.

     * The <code>doFilter</code> method of the Filter is called by the container each time a request/response pair is
     * passed through the chain due to a client request for a resource at the end of the chain. The FilterChain passed
     * in to this method allows the Filter to pass on the request and response to the next entity in the chain.
     * <p>
     * A typical implementation of this method would follow the following pattern:- <br>
     * 1. Examine the request<br>
     * 2. Optionally wrap the request object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for input
     * filtering <br>
     * 3. Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for output
     * filtering <br>
     * 4. a) <strong>Either</strong> invoke the next entity in the chain using the FilterChain object (
     * <code>chain.doFilter()</code>), <br>
     * 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the next entity in the filter chain to block
     * the request processing<br>
     * 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next entity in the filter chain.
